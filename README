fpidump -- Export SAR data from Astrium .FPI files
==================================================

Copyright (C) Peter TB Brett <p.brett@surrey.ac.uk>

`fpidump' exports synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from .fpi files
as produced by some experimental Astrium SAR sensors.

Usage
-----

`fpidump' can export image metadata in a text-based format compatible
with the common ".ini" configuration format.  For example:

  fpidump foo.fpi -m foo.meta

`fpidump' can also export image raster data in TIFF format.  The
generated TIFF will be a single-band image using either real or
complex 32-bit IEEE floating-point samples (depending on the format of
the source data), e.g.:

  fpidump foo.fpi -t foo.tiff

You can export both metadata and raster data in a single command:

  fpidump foo.fpi -m foo.met -t foo.tiff

Known bugs
----------

`fpidump' only works on x86 systems or systems with a matching integer
byte order ("little-endian").

Installing fpidump
